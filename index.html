 <p class="para">My Hobby is reading interesting,mythology and anime books.
     I like to read Harry Potter,Percy Jackson and Avatar: The Last Airbender.
     I am 11 eleven years old and study 5 grade.
     It was easy for me to develop at reading books.
     I usually read books when I finish my school homework or in my free time.
     I think reading books helps grow your imagination and creativity.
     It can also help with writing skills.I gain a lot of knowledge by reading books. </p>
